# Lab Report 4 -- Editing from Command Line

In this lab report, I would reproduce the task done in the lab, and perform the step 4-9 and explain the keys pressed during each step.

## Step 4: Log into ieng6

Keys pressed:

`ssh<space>cs15lsp23nf@ieng6.ucsd.edu<enter>`

In this command, I logged onto the ieng6 by using ssh and typing my ieng6 account

Keys pressed:

`git<space>clone<space><Command -V><enter>`

In this command, I clone the repository named `lab7` from my github.

I use `<Command -V>` to paste the clone address by SSH, which is `git@github.com:jiangqiw/lab7.git`. By copying this link, I can clone the repo and is able to git commit and push to update my changes.

## Step 6: Run the test and demonstrate fail

Keys pressed:

`bash<space>test.sh<enter>`

In the command, I use `bash` to run the `test.sh` file, which is already written to run the test. Since there is bug in the `ListExamples` file, so I see failure reported
